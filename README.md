# SystemEquationSolver
This project pretends to solve a linear system of equation.
It uses Numpy library and it is fully developed in python.

## Getting Started
You will find a test.py file which ilustrates the different functions implemented.

### Functions
- Rank of coefficient matrix (A)
- Rank of coefficient matrix concatenated with constant matrix (A|B)
- Category of the system of equations (one solution multiple or non-existence solution)
- Solver (Ax=b)
